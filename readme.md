# Implement FC and Conv NN with Numpy
These demos are completely implemented by `numpy` and can be found in `playground.ipynb`, see playground

## Dataset
### MNIST

just in order to check if FC NN can learn something from images, just serves as a begining :)

### CIFAR10

in order to test and compare differences between models, and think about why, at the same time, can deeply think the relationship b/w dataset complexity and model complexity.

## Model

### TwoLayerFC
### ThreeLayerFC
### FiveLayerFC
### ConvNet
### DeepConvNet


## Utils
Includes various layers, loss, optimizing method, trainer

## Best Params
will be saved into `params.pkl`
